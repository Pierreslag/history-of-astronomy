                <h2>The Naked Eye</h2>
                <p>
                    Humans have been observing the stars and planets with the naked eye for thousands of years.
                    Ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians and Egyptians, used the stars to track time and seasons and to navigate.

                <h2>The Telescope</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early 1600s, Galileo Galilei made significant advances in astronomy by using a telescope to observe the planets and their moons.
                    This led to the development of the refracting telescope, which uses lenses to gather and focus light.

                <h2>The Reflecting Telescope</h2>
                <p>
                    In the mid-1600s, Isaac Newton developed the reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors instead of lenses to gather and focus light.
                    This allowed for larger, more powerful telescopes to be built.

                <h2>Space Telescopes</h2>
                <p>
                    In the second half of the 20th century, several space telescopes were launched, including the Hubble Space Telescope,
                    which has provided some of the most stunning and important images of the universe.
                    Space telescopes can observe wavelengths of light that are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere,
                    and they can also be positioned to avoid interference from the Sun and other sources of light.

                <h2>Interferometer</h2>
                <p>
                    Interferometers combine light from multiple telescopes to create a single high-resolution image, allowing astronomers to study stars,
                    galaxies, and black holes in greater detail.
                    The Event Horizon Telescope, which used an array of radio telescopes, famously captured the first-ever image of a black hole in 2019.

                <h2>The Spectroscope</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1800s, Joseph von Fraunhofer developed the spectroscope, which allowed astronomers to analyze the light emitted by stars and other celestial bodies.
                    This helped to identify the chemical composition of these bodies.

                <h2>The Photographic Plate</h2>
                <p>
                    In the late 1800s, astronomers began using photographic plates to capture images of celestial objects. 
                    This allowed for more accurate and detailed observations than could be made by the human eye.

                <h2>Radio Telescopes</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early 1900s, radio telescopes were developed to observe the radio waves emitted by celestial bodies.
                    This led to the discovery of new phenomena, such as pulsars and quasars.

            <p>In 1967, astronomers discovered the first pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
            <p>In 1995, the first exoplanet was discovered orbiting a Sun-like star.</p>
            <p>In 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a "dwarf planet" instead of a full-fledged planet.</p>
            <p>In 2017, the first interstellar object, named 'Oumuamua, was discovered passing through our solar system.</p>
            <p>In 2019, the first image of a black hole was released, providing unprecedented evidence of these enigmatic objects.</p>
            <p>In 2020, scientists confirmed the existence of "pi Earth" - an exoplanet with a similar mass and radius to Earth, orbiting its star every 3.14 days.</p>
            <p>In 2021, scientists discovered a new type of planet called a "rocky geyser world," which spews out vapor and rocky debris like a geyser.</p>
            <p>In 2022, a team of scientists discovered a potentially habitable exoplanet just 31 light-years away, dubbed Gliese 486b.</p>
            <p>In 2023, a new type of exoplanet was discovered, made entirely of diamond and likely formed from a white dwarf star.</p>
